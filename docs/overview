.. title:: AtomNeb Overview

`AtomNeb (IDL) <https://atomneb.github.io/AtomNeb-idl>` is an IDL library for reading atomic data from the `AtomNeb` database for *collisionally excited lines* and *recombination lines* commonly observed in ionized nebulae.

* `AtomNeb database for collisionally excited lines` contains energy levels (Ej), collision strengths (Ωij), and transition probabilities (Aij) of the most ions commonly observed in ionized nebulae:

    - `Collection dataset` was compiled according to the atomic data used in `pyNeb v1.0 <http://www.iac.es/proyecto/PyNeb/>` and includes some improved atomic data from `Cloudy v13.04 <https://www.nublado.org/>` and the `National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Atomic Spectra Database <https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-spectra-database>`, the `CHIANTI atomic database <http://www.chiantidatabase.org/>`.

    - `Chianti52, Chianti60, and Chianti70 datasets` were compiled according to the atomic data used in the FORTRAN program `MOCASSIN <https://github.com/mocassin/MOCASSIN-2.0>`.

* `AtomNeb database for recombination lines` contains effective recombination coefficient (αeff), and Branching ratios (Br) of the most ions commonly observed in ionized nebulae.

    - `RC Collection dataset` was compiled according to the atomic data used in the FORTRAN program `MOCASSIN <https://github.com/mocassin/MOCASSIN-2.0>`, and includes C II (`Davey et al. 2000 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26AS..142...85D>`), N II (`Escalante and Victor 1990 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJS...73..513E>`), O II (`Storey 1994 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994A%26A...282..999S>`; `Liu et al. 1995 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995MNRAS.272..369L>`), and Ne II ions (`Kisielius et al. 1998 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998A%26AS..133..257K>`).

    - `SH95 Collection dataset` was compiled using hydrogenic ions for Z=1 to 8, namely H I, He II, Li III, Be IV, B V, C VI, N VII, and O VIII ions from `Storey and Hummer (1995) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995MNRAS.272...41S>`.

    - `PPB91 Collection dataset` was compiled using the atomic data for H, He, C, N, O, Ne ions from `Pequignot, Petitjean and Boisson (1991) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991A%26A...251..680P>`.

    - `PFSD12 He I dataset` was compiled using effective He I recombination coefficients from `Porter et al (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.425L..28P>` and `(2013) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.433L..89P>`.

    - `FSL13 N II dataset` was compiled using effective N II recombination coefficients from `Fang, Storey and Liu (2011) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...530A..18F>` and `(2013) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...550C...2F>`.

    - `SSB17 O II dataset` was compiled using  effective O II recombination coefficients from `Storey, Sochi and Bastin (2017) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.470..379S>`.



Dependencies
------------

* This package requires the following packages:

    - `The IDL Astronomy User's Library <https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html>`
    
* To get this package with all the dependent packages, you can simply use ``git`` command as follows::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/atomneb/AtomNeb-idl.git


GDL Installation
----------------

*  The GNU Data Language (GDL) can be installed on

    - Linux (Fedora)::

        sudo dnf install gdl
    
    - Linux (Ubuntu)::
    
        sudo apt-get install gnudatalanguage
    
    - OS X::
    
        brew install gnudatalanguage
    
    - Windows: using the `GNU Data Language for Win32 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudatalanguage-win32/>` (Unofficial Version) or compiling the `GitHub source <https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl>` with Visual Studio 2015 as seen in `appveyor.yml <https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/blob/master/appveyor.yml>`.


* To setup `AtomNeb-idl <https://atomneb.github.io/AtomNeb-idl>` in GDL, add its path to ``.gdl_startup`` in the home directory::

    !PATH=!PATH + ':/home/AtomNeb-idl/pro/'
    !PATH=!PATH + ':/home/AtomNeb-idl/externals/astron/pro/'

  Set ``GDL_STARTUP`` in ``.bashrc`` (bash)::

    export GDL_STARTUP=~/.gdl_startup

  or in ``.tcshrc`` (cshrc)::

    setenv GDL_STARTUP ~/.gdl_startup

* This package needs GDL version 0.9.8 or later.

IDL Installation
----------------
